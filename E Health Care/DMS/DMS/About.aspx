           The information in your organisation can split into two basic types.  Structured data is that held in your line of business application, probably with some form of SQL database to manage the information.  Unstructured data is the documents you create using Office packages (letters, spreadsheets, incoming paper, etc.)
Most organisations invest in a system that will help to run their business, but often rely on the standard filing tools within Windows for managing the unstructured data.  Depending on the organisation, up to 80% of data can be unstructured.  Is it safe to leave the management of this information to luck?
Document and Content Management provides structure to his unstructured data.  As users save information they are prompted to provide the structure.  This combined with the ability to quickly search the content of documents means retrieval is fast.
